# running the project

In order to run the project, you need to first create a `env.js` file in the root of the project.

export default API_KEY;
```

The API key is a private key generated from TMDb. To generate an API key [visit this link](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

You can then run the app by running:

```
expo start
```
